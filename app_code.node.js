Creating a detailed starter code for the application in Node.js would be quite extensive and beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide you with a basic structure and some sample code snippets to get you started.

Here's a basic project structure:

```
/myapp
  /node_modules
  /public
    /images
    /javascripts
    /stylesheets
      style.css
  /routes
    index.js
    users.js
  /views
    error.jade
    index.jade
    layout.jade
  app.js
  package.json
```

Here's a sample `app.js` file:

```javascript
// Import required modules
var express = require('express');
var path = require('path');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var logger = require('morgan');

// Import routes
var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');
var usersRouter = require('./routes/users');

var app = express();

// Set up middleware
app.use(logger('dev'));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Set up routes
app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/users', usersRouter);

// Error handling
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  // Set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get('env') === 'development' ? err : {};

  // Render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render('error');
});

module.exports = app;
```

Here's a sample `routes/index.js` file:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
});

module.exports = router;
```

This is a very basic setup and doesn't include any Azure services. You would need to use the appropriate Azure SDKs to interact with Azure services. For example, to use Azure SQL Database, you would need to use the `mssql` package. To use Azure Storage, you would need to use the `@azure/storage-blob` package. To use Azure Active Directory, you would need to use the `passport-azure-ad` package.

Please note that this is a very basic setup and doesn't include any error handling, validation, authentication, or other important aspects of a production-ready application. You would need to add these yourself based on your specific requirements.
